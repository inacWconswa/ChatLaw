In this article, we will show you how to get a free evaluation copy of Holophase Circad from the official website. We will also explain some of the key features and benefits of using this software for your PCB projects. By the end of this article, you will be able to start designing your own circuits with Holophase Circad without spending a dime.
 
## How to Download Holophase Circad for Free
 
The first step to download Holophase Circad for free is to visit the official website at [http://www.holophase.com/](http://www.holophase.com/). There, you will find information about the software, its features, and its history. You will also see a link to download an evaluation copy of Holophase Circad.
 
There are two versions of Holophase Circad available for download: Version 6 (OmniGlyph-V6) and Version 5 (OmniGlyph-V5). Version 6 is the latest version that is compatible with Windows Vista, Windows 7, and Windows 8. It has a new drawing engine that matches the new display paradigm of these operating systems. Version 5 is an older version that has an expanded drawing area and resolution, an integrated text editor, and enhanced pixel image processing for reverse engineering. Both versions have the same user interface and functionality.
 
To download either version of Holophase Circad, you need to fill out a form with some information about yourself, such as your name, email address, country, and occupation. This information is used by Holophase to improve their products and services. They will not pass your details onto anyone else. After filling out the form, you will be redirected to the download site where you can choose the version you want to download.
 
The download file is a ZIP archive that contains the installation program and some documentation files. You need to extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer and run the setup.exe file to install Holophase Circad. The installation process is simple and straightforward. You just need to follow the instructions on the screen and accept the license agreement. The installation program will create a shortcut on your desktop and in your start menu for easy access.
 
## Key Features and Benefits of Holophase Circad
 
Once you have installed Holophase Circad on your computer, you can start using it to design your own PCBs. Here are some of the key features and benefits of using this software:
 
- **Schematic Capture:** To design a schematic, simply open a schematic drawing sheet and start placing components. Connect them together using wires, buses, and signal ports. More complex circuits may require a multi-sheet schematic -- also easily accomplished with one set of signal names common to all schematic sheets.
- **Netlist Generation:** After a schematic is complete (or complete enough), all component and interconnection data is compiled and written to disk as a netlist file. Multi-sheet schematics will produce multiple netlists that will be merged by the PCB editor.
- **PCB Layout:** While slurping in the netlist, Holophase Circad will automatically select the components from the various library files and line them up along the bottom of the board file. If a component already exists from a previous design cycle, its parameters will be updated to reflect the new information. The components must be manually positioned into the desired locations for each individual part. A ratsnest of interconnections may be used to aid in component placement. Although routing of the necessary signal tracks is best done manually, an autorouter is available to assist with the simpler and more tedious operations such as SMT power/ground fanout.
- **Copper Pour:** While multi-layer PCBs rely on unbroken power and ground planes on internal 8cf37b1e13
