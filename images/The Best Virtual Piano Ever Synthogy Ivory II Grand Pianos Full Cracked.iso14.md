One of the most impressive features of Synthogy Ivory II Grand Pianos is the Sympathetic String Resonance technology, which simulates the natural resonance of the piano strings when you play. This adds a rich and complex layer of sound that makes the virtual pianos sound more alive and organic. You can also adjust the level of resonance to suit your preference and style.
 
Another feature that enhances the realism and expression of Synthogy Ivory II Grand Pianos is the Half Pedaling feature, which allows you to control the amount of damper pedal effect by how far you press the pedal.
